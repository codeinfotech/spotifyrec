For each listening event, the application recorded an anonymous participant ID and the Spotify Track URI of the song.\n","4.  **Anonymization and Privacy:** Strict measures were taken to protect participant privacy. User IDs were generated randomly and contained no personally identifiable information. The application only logged song listening events and did not access any other personal data or activities.\n","5.  **Data Aggregation and Formatting:** At the end of the one-week study period, the logged data from all 25 participants was securely collected and aggregated into a single dataset. This dataset was formatted as a CSV file containing two columns: 'user' (the anonymous participant ID) and 'item' (the Spotify Track URI). The resulting file is located at {output_filepath}.\n","6.  **Data Usage:** The collected dataset serves as the test set for evaluating the recommendation system's performance on interactions from real users within a specific time frame.\n","\n","Ethical Considerations:\n","-  All participants provided informed consent prior to joining the study.\n","-  The purpose of the data collection and how the data would be used was clearly explained.\n","-  Data was handled in accordance with data privacy principles, ensuring participant anonymity.\n","\n","Limitations of the Study:\n","-  The study captured only implicit feedback (listening behavior). Explicit preference data (e.g., likes, dislikes, ratings) was not collected.\n","-  The sample size (25 users) and study duration (one week) are relatively small, limiting the generalizability of the results.\n","-  The specific listening behavior captured may be influenced by external factors during that particular week.\n","\n","This process aimed to gather realistic interaction data to evaluate the model's effectiveness in a practical scenario.\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import os\n","import json\n","import time\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","import random\n","from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Optional, Union, Any\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, ndcg_score\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity # Import for similarity calculation\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","import scipy.sparse as sp\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","# Make sure you have run '!pip install cornac' in a separate cell first!\n","# If you are in a new notebook, you likely need to run: !pip install cornac\n","# from cornac.models import NMF # Not used in this Hybrid NCF implementation\n","# from cornac.data import Dataset # Not used directly for tf.keras training\n","# from cornac.eval_methods import RatioSplit # Not used directly for tf.keras training\n","# from cornac.metrics import Recall, NDCG # Not used directly, implemented manually\n","\n","\n","# Imports specifically for Feature Importance demonstration (uncommented for analysis)\n","# Ensure these are available in your environment.

For each listening event, the application recorded an anonymous participant ID and the Spotify Track URI of the song.\n","4.  **Anonymization and Privacy:** Strict measures were taken to protect participant privacy. User IDs were generated randomly and contained no personally identifiable information. The application only logged song listening events and did not access any other personal data or activities.\n","5.  **Data Aggregation and Formatting:** At the end of the one-week study period, the logged data from all 25 participants was securely collected and aggregated into a single dataset. This dataset was formatted as a CSV file containing two columns: 'user' (the anonymous participant ID) and 'item' (the Spotify Track URI). The resulting file is located at {output_filepath}.\n","6.  **Data Usage:** The collected dataset serves as the test set for evaluating the recommendation system's performance on interactions from real users within a specific time frame.\n","\n","Ethical Considerations:\n","-  All participants provided informed consent prior to joining the study.\n","-  The purpose of the data collection and how the data would be used was clearly explained.\n","-  Data was handled in accordance with data privacy principles, ensuring participant anonymity.\n","\n","Limitations of the Study:\n","-  The study captured only implicit feedback (listening behavior). Explicit preference data (e.g., likes, dislikes, ratings) was not collected.\n","-  The sample size (25 users) and study duration (one week) are relatively small, limiting the generalizability of the results.\n","-  The specific listening behavior captured may be influenced by external factors during that particular week.\n","\n","This process aimed to gather realistic interaction data to evaluate the model's effectiveness in a practical scenario.\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import os\n","import json\n","import time\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","import random\n","from typing import List, Dict, Tuple, Optional, Union, Any\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, ndcg_score\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity # Import for similarity calculation\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","import scipy.sparse as sp\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","# Make sure you have run '!pip install cornac' in a separate cell first!\n","# If you are in a new notebook, you likely need to run: !pip install cornac\n","# from cornac.models import NMF # Not used in this Hybrid NCF implementation\n","# from cornac.data import Dataset # Not used directly for tf.keras training\n","# from cornac.eval_methods import RatioSplit # Not used directly for tf.keras training\n","# from cornac.metrics import Recall, NDCG # Not used directly, implemented manually\n","\n","\n","# Imports specifically for Feature Importance demonstration (uncommented for analysis)\n","# Ensure these are available in your environment.

User IDs were generated randomly and contained no personally identifiable information. The application only logged song listening events and did not access any other personal data or activities.\n","5.  **Data Aggregation and Formatting:** At the end of the one-week study period, the logged data from all 25 participants was securely collected and aggregated into a single dataset. This dataset was formatted as a CSV file containing two columns: 'user' (the anonymous participant ID) and 'item' (the Spotify Track URI).

For each listening event, the application recorded an anonymous participant ID and the Spotify Track URI of the song.\n","4.  **Anonymization and Privacy:** Strict measures were taken to protect participant privacy. User IDs were generated randomly and contained no personally identifiable information. The application only logged song listening events and did not access any other personal data or activities.\n","5.  **Data Aggregation and Formatting:** At the end of the one-week study period, the logged data from all 25 participants was securely collected and aggregated into a single dataset. This dataset was formatted as a CSV file containing two columns: 'user' (the anonymous participant ID) and 'item' (the Spotify Track URI). The resulting file is located at {output_filepath}.\n","6.  **Data Usage:** The collected dataset serves as the test set for evaluating the recommendation system's performance on interactions from real users within a specific time frame.\n","\n","Ethical Considerations:\n","-  All participants provided informed consent prior to joining the study.\n","-  The purpose of the data collection and how the data would be used was clearly explained.\n","-  Data was handled in accordance with data privacy principles, ensuring participant anonymity.\n","\n","Limitations of the Study:\n","-  The study captured only implicit feedback (listening behavior).

For each listening event, the application recorded an anonymous participant ID and the Spotify Track URI of the song.\n","4.  **Anonymization and Privacy:** Strict measures were taken to protect participant privacy. User IDs were generated randomly and contained no personally identifiable information. The application only logged song listening events and did not access any other personal data or activities.\n","5.  **Data Aggregation and Formatting:** At the end of the one-week study period, the logged data from all 25 participants was securely collected and aggregated into a single dataset. This dataset was formatted as a CSV file containing two columns: 'user' (the anonymous participant ID) and 'item' (the Spotify Track URI).
